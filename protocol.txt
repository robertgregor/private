USB stick

AT+c=ch<ENTER> - ch - channel number 1 - 83
AT+p=ABCDE<ENTER> - ABCDE - password exactly 5 characters
AT+a=nnn<ENTER> - add new device device id nnn = 1 - 255
AT+ddd=Cmd - specific device command ddd = device Id, Cmd = command

Light/Alarm controller

ala - alarm On In this mode the senzor will notify the Computer one time about the intrusion
ald - alarm deactivation
alce=nnn - alarm configuration enter alarm timeout nnn = 0 to 255 seconds
alcl=nnn - alarm configuration leave alarm timeout nnn = 0 to 255 seconds

l1o - light 1 on
l1of - light 1 on and off after timeout period
l1f - light 1 off
l1co - configure light 1 to swith on when applied power
l1cf - configure light 1 to stay off when applied power
l1cd - configure light 1 to switch on when movement detected
l1cc - cancel light 1 to switch on when movement detected
l1ct=nnn - configure light 1 timeout nnn = 0 to 255 minutes (0 means forewer) minutes
pn - check weather the device is up and runing (ping command)
sa - return status 1|a|Alarm|sensor|alenter|alleave
	Alarm 0 disabled, 1 enabled, 2 activated, 3 leave timeout running, 4 enter timeout running
	sensor - 0 nothing detected, 1 detected
	alenter - enter alarm timeout in seconds
	alleave - leave alarm timeout in seconds
sc - return status 1|c|light|power|onWhenMovement|configuredTimeout|currentTimeout
	light 0 off, 1 on
	power 0 on when applied power, 1 stay off when applied power
	onWhenMovement 1 - on when movement detected 0 no action
	configuredTimeout - no of minutes, when l1 will go off, 0 forewer
	currentTimeout - current light 1 timeout in minutes, 0 - never switch off
	

Temperature sensor

pn - check weather the device is up and runing (ping command)
s - return status 2|temperature|battery|frequency
	temperature format - always sign, 2 decimals degree celsius, dot, 2 decimals, e.g +23.32 or -02.32 or +02.20
	battery voltage e.g. 2.9 or 3.0
	frequency - frequency in seconds to send status. Longer value, longer battery life
m=nnn - set the frequency and put to the sleep mode. 1 means 10 seconds, 255 means 2550 seconds. Needs to be set to put the device to sleep mode!!!
	If not set, or set to 0, then no sleep - usefull for testing, but consume lot of power and batery will be quicly empty.

If in sleep mode, the command should be send within 2 seconds, after the status is send. Othervise the system is in sleep mode
and radio is off.

Simple switch

pn - check weather the device is up and runing (ping command)
l1o - light 1 on
l1of - light 1 on and off after timeout period
l1f - light 1 off
l1co - configure light 1 to swith on when applied power
l1cf - configure light 1 to stay off when applied power
l1ct=nnn - configure light 1 timeout nnn = 0 to 255 minutes (0 means forewer) minutes
s - return status 3|light|power|configuredTimeout|currentTimeout
	light 0 off, 1 on
	power 0 on when applied power, 1 stay off when applied power
	onWhenMovement 1 - on when movement detected 0 no action
	configuredTimeout - no of minutes, when l1 will go off, 0 forewer
	currentTimeout - current light 1 timeout in minutes, 0 - never switch off
